North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in Vietnam in his heavily armored train, ahead of his two day summit with US President Donald Trump in the capital Hanoi.

The summit, the second since the two leaders met in Singapore last June, is expected to build upon their agreement to "work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
Critics say that meeting -- the first between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president -- failed to produce concrete action in getting the North to give up its nuclear weapons.
After a two-and-a-half-day trip that covered about 2,800 miles overland, Kim arrived Tuesday to a red carpet welcome at 8:15 a.m. local time at the Dong Dang railway station in the border town of Dong Dang in Vietnam's Lang Song province.
